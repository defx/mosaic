# Combobox

The combobox for choosing the name of a US state or territory demonstrates the Combobox Pattern. The design pattern describes four types of autocomplete behavior. This example illustrates the autocomplete behavior known as list autocomplete with manual selection. If the user types one or more characters in the edit box and the typed characters match the beginning of the name of one or more states or territories, a listbox popup appears containing the matching names. When the listbox appears, a suggested name is not automatically selected. Thus, after typing, if the user tabs or clicks out of the combobox without choosing a value from the listbox, the typed string becomes the value of the combobox. Note that this implementation enables users to input the name of a state or territory, but it does not prevent input of any other arbitrary value.
