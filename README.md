# mosaic

Mosaic is a node command line utility made primarily for transforming and combining HTML assets.

It is configured using a config file named mosaic.config.js. This file is used to define custom rules for a project, allowing developers to write custom tasks that they want to perform when bundling files together.

Mosaic also provides a dev server that can be used as an HTTP server for serving and rebuilding files automatically while developing.
