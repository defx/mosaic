# Mosaic

## Accelerate your UI development

ðŸš§ Please kindly note that this project is a work in progress. Collaborators welcome ðŸš§

## Mosaic allows authors to write once and run anywhere

Mosaic enables UI behaviour to be described using a combination of functional programming and declarative configuration, separating behaviour from presentation to ensure maximum reusability.

## Mosaic enables teams to focus on UI presentation

Get a head start on UI development by leveraging UI behaviour that is
highly performant, accessible, and fully tested straight out of the box, letting you focus on your project presentation.

## Example

The following configuration implements the Accordion pattern:

```js
let counter = 0

export const Accordion = () => {
  const id = counter++
  return {
    state: {
      openPanel: 0,
    },
    action: {
      togglePanel: (state, { index }) => ({
        ...state,
        openPanel: state.openPanel === index ? -1 : index,
      }),
    },
    elements: [
      {
        select: "button[accordion-toggle]",
        attribute: (state, i) => ({
          id: `trigger_${id}_${i}`,
          ariaControls: `panel_${id}_${i}`,
          ariaExpanded: state.openPanel === i,
        }),
        on: {
          click: "togglePanel",
        },
      },
      {
        select: "[accordion-panel]",
        attribute: (state, i) => ({
          id: `panel_${id}_${i}`,
          ariaLabelledby: `trigger_${id}_${i}`,
          hidden: state.openPanel !== i,
        }),
      },
    ],
  }
}
```

As you can see from the example above, the behaviour is described separately from the markup. This separation of concerns allows the same behaviour to be reused with custom HTML markup and styles fitting the requirements of a specific project. The only restrictions upon markup are imposed by the _selectors_. Generally these selectors are just custom attributes (e.g., `[accordion-panel]`) that aren't tied to any specific element type. In some cases however, more specificity may be employed to ensure accessibility (as seen with the `button[accordion-toggle]` selector in the example above).
